# Mini Project : Elevator Controller System

---
## Summary 
This project aims to develop an electronic elevator control system for an 8-story hotel building using digital logic circuits. We need to build a '3-bit synchronous UP/DOWN counter' using JK flip-flops simulated through DEEDS software. This system requires the integration of components such as comparators, clock enablers, and pattern detectors to ensure that the elevator stops exactly at the selected floor. In addition to the basic functions, we are also required to add security features such as visitor access card detectors, passcodes, and door status indicators. Each group must document the design process in a complete technical report with circuit diagrams and state transition tables. Finally, a 15-minute demonstration video must be prepared to demonstrate the functionality of the circuit simulation before the submission deadline.

## Reflection
Through this project, I learned how to apply the concepts of digital logic theory to the real world by building a 3-bit synchronous counter circuit using JK flip-flops. I realized that full concentration is needed in building a state transition table because a small error in the logic input can cause the entire elevator system to fail to function efficiently in the DEEDS simulation. In addition, I also realized the importance of integrating security features such as access card and passcode detectors, which taught me that technological development is not just about functionality, but also about user protection. This project also honed my problem-solving skills when it came to coordinating various components such as comparators and clock enablers so that the elevator would move smoothly to the selected floor. Finally, working in a group made me realize that clear communication is the key to completing a complex circuit design within the specified time frame.
